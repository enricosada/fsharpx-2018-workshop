This workshop will guide you step by step to add .net core/standard support to an existing project.
Enrico will provide an example project as use case, but you will be able to use your
project, following same steps.

The goal of this workshop is to add, in parallel to current code, the new .net standard/core
functionality.

You will also learn how to use new sdk, in parallel to existing code to make it easier the transition,
how to check for .net standard portability issues (dependencies/code), add .net standard support
for libraries, support previous target framework (.NET), pack it in the same nuget package,
adapt build orchestration and CI (like travis/appveyor) and make it cross platform friendly
to developers, not only final artifact.
